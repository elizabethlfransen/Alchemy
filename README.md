# Alchemy
An up and coming alchemy tech minecraft mod that allows transmuting items from one to another.

## Development Progress
Refer to github issues to review progress to initial release.

## About
Alchemy rotates around two main machines: Codenamed The **Constructor** and the **Deconstructor**. The Deconstructor
takes items and turns them into **Raw Matter**. Raw Matter has a purity which is affected by the **Catalyst** used in
the Deconstructor. Different catalysts affect the speed at which items are deconstructed and the purity of the matter
out. The raw matter is then combined in the constructor to create the new item, but in order for an item to be 
constructed a **Pattern** must be made of the item first in the **Scanner**. The Pattern stores a scan method for 
building the item but the practical construction may not match the actual yield after construction. Patterns may be
improved by scanning more items of the same kind in the Scanner. Deconstructing items is not 100% efficient either,
better catalysts can be used to increase efficiency of the output. The efficiency is tied to the purity of the Raw
Matter mentioned earlier. 

## Configuration
**TODO**
